The City of Toronto has implemented the TransformTO Net Zero Strategy, which is a net-zero carbon emission goal by 2040. The city would like to showcase building carbon emissions, water usage, and energy consumption publicly online in order to implement regulations pushing toward the Net Zero Existing Building strategy. This repository will showcase a low fidelity prototype used to test how successful the design is using Google's Lighthouse Score.

This project is apart of the University of Toronto's first year undergraduate design course: Engineering Strategies and Practice II, and is licensed under an MIT License.
